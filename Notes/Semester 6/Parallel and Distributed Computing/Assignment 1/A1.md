## Thread Mapping Planning

- [ ] study affinity [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_setaffinity_np.3.html)
- [ ] create a plan to map the threads
- [ ] consider factors such as the number of available cores, workload distribution,<br>and potential resource contention.


## Implementation

- [ ] Create 8 threads
- [ ] Read 8 different parts of the file using file pointer and thread
- [ ] every thread will return a list to the main function
- [ ] combine all the lists into 1
- [ ] research which sort will be better for this situation
- [ ] apply that sort with multi threading
- [ ] incorporate pthread_setaffinity_np


## Testing

- [ ] Measure execution time
- [ ] analyze performance with and without CPU affinity for both serial and parallel.
- [ ] Document Eveything
